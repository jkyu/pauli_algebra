    1. generate two vectors of length size**2 with elements sampled uniformly

    2. the second vector is multiplied by i to make it imaginary.
       adding the vectors elementwise yields a complex vector in C^(size**2)
    3. the complex vector is resized as (size, size) and symmetrized.

    Notes:
    - working with vectors and reshaping is fine because C^(size**2)
      is isomorphic to C^(size x size)
    - I would have liked to sample in (-bound, bound) to match the exact
      ask by the prompt, but np.random.uniform() includes the lower bound.
      There is 0 probability of sampling -bound, so maybe this is close
      enough for now.
